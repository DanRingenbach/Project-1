# A Grand Day Out
## Description
For this project my partner and I wanted to create a functional web application that would aid the user in the planning of memorable day trips to the great outdoors. Sometimes deciding on a destination is one of the hardest things to do when planning a day outdoors. With our application the user can access a list of *Federally Registered Recreation Areas* in their city.  These areas range from historical sites to nature preserves with trails for hiking and picnicing. In addition to suggested destinations our application provides the *Air Quality Index* for the area searched. When planning a day of hiking or even just picnicing the pollution levels are important to keep in mind. With the information provided by our application the user should have an easier time choosing how to spend their day outdoors. 

Through the building of this application my partner and I learned how to access data from multiple API calls and how to interpret and display that data for a user.

## Usage
To use our application **A Grand Day Out** all the user has to do is input their city of choice in the form on the homepage. After submitting the user is then presented with a list of recreation sites and the air quality index of the selected city. A back button is provided for the user to return to the homepage and input another city as necessary.
